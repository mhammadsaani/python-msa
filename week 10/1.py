# Data Structure 

# Data structures are used for storing data and organizing!

# variables -> stores data like 20 years old. 

# print age, then it will print 25


## strings ==>  

# Computer => Cabinet -> Salt, Pepper
# text -> Computer ? 
# print("Hammad".count("a"))




marks = [61, 23, 61]


# append_item = marks.append(20) # put item to last of the list
# clears_items = marks.clear()  # delete all the items from the list
# copy_list = marks.copy()      # copy all the items into new list and then we can store it in variable
# count_item_occurence = marks.count(61)  # count the occurence of item given as an argument
# print(count_item_occurence)

# marks.extend([45, 50, 55])
# print(marks)





# def hammads_extends(myList, iterable):
    
#     for x in iterable:
#         myList.append(x)
        
        
#     return myList



# print(hammads_extends(marks, 'james'))


# 'j'
# 'a'
# 'm'
# 'e'
# 's'




# marks.index()





# a = [1, 2, 3]

# b = a.copy()

# b.append(30)

# print(a, b)
